/**
 * The declared object model for the Zotero library, and what may be done to
 * each kind of object.
 *
 * Before this module the ontology was implicit and wrong: `resolveRegularItem`
 * (14 lines, module-private) returned `null` for notes and annotations and
 * silently substituted the **parent** for a child attachment. It governed the
 * tag, collection-membership and metadata write paths, so "file this note
 * into a folder" reported "Item not found" for an item that plainly existed,
 * and "tag this attachment" tagged a different object entirely.
 *
 * The rule here is that every (operation x object kind) pair has exactly two
 * legal answers — allowed, or refused with a specific reason. Never a silent
 * redirect, never a fabricated count. A pair nobody declared is reported as
 * *unmodelled*, which reads as an omission to be fixed rather than a policy
 * decision, and routes to `zotero_script`.
 *
 * Deviation from the plan worth recording: the plan listed stored / linked /
 * imported-URL attachments as separate kinds. They are folded into
 * `standaloneAttachment` / `childAttachment` here, because for every
 * operation in this matrix the answer turns on whether the object is
 * top-level, not on how its file is stored. The storage mode matters for
 * relinking, which lives under `update` and is enforced by the attachment
 * tool itself.
